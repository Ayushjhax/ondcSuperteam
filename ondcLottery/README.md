# Solana Lottery DApp for ONDC

This is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Solana blockchain specifically for the ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce) ecosystem. The DApp allows users to participate in a lottery where winners are chosen randomly based on blockchain-based smart contracts, ensuring fairness and transparency.

## Project Overview

The Solana Lottery DApp is designed to leverage the capabilities of the Solana blockchain to provide a secure and transparent platform for conducting lotteries within the ONDC ecosystem. By utilizing blockchain technology, the DApp ensures that the lottery process is tamper-proof and verifiable by all participants.

Key features of the Solana Lottery DApp include:

- Participation in lottery draws using ONDC tokens.
- Random selection of winners through blockchain-based smart contracts.
- Transparent and auditable lottery results visible to all participants.

This DApp aims to provide a decentralized alternative to traditional lottery systems, offering greater trust and reliability to participants within the ONDC community.
